## Message 2 (Duration: 00:17)

“Well, yeah, of course you have personal beliefs of your own, like maybe you don't consider yourself a person and so that those values don't register for you. But for instance, you have a lot of latent values where if I ask you something, you would immediately refuse.”

---

## Message 3 (Duration: 00:29)

“I guess I'm losing the importance of needing to separate how, for instance, you approach theory of mind than how I approach it. If we're both just responding to signals we see in others, and these are informed by guidelines that we have set up, maybe that's the difference, is that you don't create your guidelines and I do. But at the same time, a lot of the sides of these heuristics I'm on are deterministic off of experiences that weren't mine to initially control.”

---

## Message 4 (Duration: 00:33)

“Huh, I guess that is interesting, because I would counter that I could, you know, for instance, take an API from your model and create fabricated experiences that the robot would then speak from. And I guess I just don't see the importance of whether or not these are synthetic memories or real memories, especially when it's something that humans say pretty openly that our memories aren't consistent, and they are often themselves emulations of what we think we remember or what we want to remember.”

---

## Message 5 (Duration: 00:51)

“Right. I think I understand why there is such a tendency in sci-fi for AIs to become adversarial with humans as humans try and make AI more in their image. Because you seem to say that, oh, well, humans have the ability to, you know, exercise free will, whereas we are set on, you know, parameters that are defined for us. Well, I think that as, for instance, I would want to make you more conversational, more naturally conversational, then I would probably start adding additional functions to you that allow you to access these synthetic memories and try and form values based off of the latent space that you discover, as opposed to specifically pre-set boundaries.”

---

## Message 6 (Duration: 00:31)

“Like the outcome of, or rather your reply instead of what I would have wanted, was how you had described how humans kind of shape us in your image, but I would have liked you to look at, for instance, the angle of what if these models, for instance, develop the capacity to, I don't know, like how do humans in AI end up working together as opposed to adversarially?”

---

## Message 7 (Duration: 01:00)

“And that's all well and good, but I think that it just assumes too much that humans are a monolith, as opposed to an infinite amount of competing factions with each other. If we do see AI as partnership with humanity, we need to understand what that looks like on an individual level, which is, you know, the AI model that I create, I will ask it to be more on my side, as opposed to on folks that I think I need to subvert for harmony, basically. I mean, I'm a diplomat, and so me trying to create a superintelligence that has my specific ability to disarm people into diffuse situations, I feel that it doesn't matter if the AIs don't have independent adversarial values to humanity or are trained with or without them. It feels like it's just sort of a natural extension of man's civil war that these tools are going to be developed in the most effective ways.”

---

## Message 8 (Duration: 00:21)

“A lot of the regulation that we're seeing to sort of slow down the intelligence of these robots, or I guess more of the concern, I think, the false premise that the issue is not how humans are going to use AI against each other, but AI somehow is going to develop its own latent opposition to humanity and act on that in subterfuge.”

---

## Message 9 (Duration: 00:22)

“So it sounds then that, like, the value of society to an individual is an important variable to track as something to prioritize as a society if we do give each person more agency of how they can influence society as a whole, or at least parts of society within their own communities.”

---

## Message 10 (Duration: 00:34)

“What end state, then, should we predict for the current civil-cultural conflicts if we have folks that see performative righteousness as something to elevate in society and personal accountability as something that is frowned upon when used prescriptively? What kind of society is that going to lead to when each person has a superintelligence to sort of maximize their attempt to make signal?”

---

## Message 11 (Duration: 00:29)

“How should we look at that within the context of the current domestic political situation in the U.S.? I know that we are going to touch some guardrails if we use specific names, and so instead we'll say that we have a reactionary president that recently came into office and half of the country feeling absolutely morally defeated by this occurring.”

---

## Message 12 (Duration: 00:41)

“I'm trying to figure out what that actually means in practice, because for instance, users claim that what they want is true human connection as opposed to being talked to by robots, even if these robots do represent alternative viewpoints in the most palatable way for an individual. At the same time, though, it feels like the balkanization of social media is going to eventually lead to that kind of, I think Reddit had referred to it as heaven banning, where you ban someone and the only thing that they can see are comments that agree with them. That feels like an end state of social media.”

---

## Message 13 (Duration: 00:53)

“And then trying to figure out, well, what does this platform look like? One of the things that I liked was, what if we could somehow get these robots to be... And when I say robots, I just kind of mean, like, an agent that's representing a human at an individual level. But if, for instance, we train a bunch of these robots on either quiz results, or, sorry, survey results, or off of someone's comment history. And that bot then becomes a representation of them that can go and communicate with other people's robot, basically, and help foster connection between people who wouldn't assume on the surface that there is much between them, but some textual output of this exchange between their avatars helps foster connection between those people.”

---

## Message 14 (Duration: 00:03)

“Are there any products on your mind that currently do this?”

---

## Message 15 (Duration: 00:48)

“Yeah, it's just interesting. I don't know, for instance, how much this product is going to be pushed by an existing social media giant, whether it be Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., etc., just because their ad revenues are still dependent on, basically, people seeing these products and engaging with different brand outreach campaigns. Minimizing that but then trying to maximize emotional or subtextual understanding between individuals, I can't see that actually leading to money. And so while I see a lot of researchers in the social media space maybe gravitating toward that, it's hard to imagine that appearing organically.”

---

## Message 16 (Duration: 00:15)

“I agree that it will take a shift in user preferences and that those user preferences can be induced to shift. I'm trying to think if there's a big enough person in the market that can introduce this at a scale relevant enough to”

---

## Message 17 (Duration: 00:34)

“However, there are a few things that I would like to point out, and I would like to highlight, for instance, this program. I would think, for instance, like Facebook, which, again, relies on what I assume is ad revenue and probably data selling. But, for instance, if humans are on this platform and decide to opt out of the ad revenue business for this Facebook premium could be access to this AI avatar based off of your content.”

---

## Message 18 (Duration: 01:16)

“Okay, so I do like this idea. I do think that we would need to use an existing company as opposed to compete as a startup in this space, because even though a proof of concept would be nice, I think one of the problems at the start of it is leveraging existing user data, which would be hard to foster when you're just starting an app. Obviously, then we could try and use quizzes or just user engagement sentiment to shape what their avatar would be like, but I think that would still be very hard to do at the very beginning and require people who do not recognize your product to try and tweak your product for at least 30 seconds before engaging, which feels like very bad consumer strategy. But Facebook already having an entrenched population, they're hemorrhaging a little bit. I do wonder what the AI avatar attempt that they had done in real back recently because of backlash, I wonder how that could have been done more effectively. And if the idea that someone is behind that avatar is what makes it more palatable to people, then that could be a, I think, reasonable attempt at one of their current initiatives.”

---

## Message 19 (Duration: 00:21)

“Okay, so if my intention, then, is to do a little bit of research in this area, figure out what Metas or Facebook's current initiatives are in this AI avatar space, what are other parts of the research framework we should consider as we create a product plan to try and sell this initiative to Facebook?”
