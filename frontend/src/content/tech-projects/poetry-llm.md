# Poetry Analysis with Large Language Models

This project represents a sophisticated approach to computational poetry analysis, leveraging the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide deep, nuanced insights into poetic works. The system combines multiple AI models to offer diverse perspectives while maintaining high reliability and consistency.

## The Vision

Traditional computational approaches to poetry analysis often struggle to capture the nuanced, multifaceted nature of poetic expression. This project bridges that gap by orchestrating multiple state-of-the-art language models, each contributing its unique perspective while maintaining consistent output formatting and reliable error handling.

## Technical Implementation

The system architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Advanced Multi-Model Analysis Engine**
   - Parallel processing using latest models: Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4 Turbo, and Gemini Pro
   - Structured prompt engineering with robust response parsing
   - Rate-limited concurrent processing with semaphores
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

2. **Type-Safe Content Management**
   - Fully typed TypeScript frontend components
   - Git-integrated version control
   - Automated frontmatter management with validation
   - Efficient markdown processing pipeline

3. **Interactive Web Interface**
   - Next.js-based frontend with TypeScript
   - Real-time analysis overlay with line highlighting
   - Responsive dark/light mode theming
   - Graceful error state handling

## Current Status

The project has reached several key milestones:
- âœ… Enhanced analysis engine with latest LLM models
- âœ… Robust response parsing and validation
- âœ… Type-safe frontend implementation
- âœ… Interactive poem analysis overlay
- ðŸš§ Advanced visualization features
- ðŸš§ Comparative analysis tools
- ðŸ“‹ API documentation

## Future Directions

Planned enhancements include:
- Sentiment analysis visualization
- Cross-model analysis comparison
- Poetry style classification
- Public API for external applications
- Collaborative annotation features
