# Poetry Analysis with Large Language Models

This project represents a novel approach to computational poetry analysis, leveraging the unique capabilities of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide deep, nuanced insights into poetic works.

## The Vision

Traditional computational approaches to poetry analysis often fall short of capturing the rich, multifaceted nature of poetic expression. This project aims to bridge that gap by combining the strengths of multiple state-of-the-art language models, each bringing its own perspective to the analysis.

## Technical Implementation

The system is built around three main components:

1. **Multi-Model Analysis Engine**
   - Parallel processing of poems through Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini
   - Structured prompt engineering for consistent analysis
   - Intelligent response parsing and aggregation

2. **Content Management System**
   - Automated frontmatter handling
   - Git-based version control integration
   - Markdown processing with metadata preservation

3. **Web Interface**
   - Next.js-based frontend for displaying analyses
   - Interactive comparison of different LLM interpretations
   - Dark/light mode theming

## Current Status

The project is actively being developed with the following milestones:
- Core analysis engine implementation
- Basic frontmatter management
- Initial web interface
- Advanced visualization features
- Comparative analysis tools
- API documentation

## Future Directions

Planned enhancements include:
- Integration with additional LLM providers
- Enhanced visualization of poetic devices
- Collaborative analysis features
- API access for external applications
