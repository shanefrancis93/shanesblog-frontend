# Research Pipeline Component Descriptions

## Main Components

### Research Problem
The starting point of the pipeline, representing the complex research question or topic that requires investigation. Research problems are decomposed into manageable components for systematic exploration.

### Research Pipeline
The overarching system that coordinates the flow of information through the various stages of research, ensuring methodical progression from problem definition to final output.

### LLM Orchestration Layer
The intelligent coordination mechanism that assigns specific epistemic tasks to the most suitable AI models based on their unique strengths. This layer implements epistemic task decomposition and bidding mechanisms to ensure optimal model assignment.

### Research Template
A structured framework populated by the orchestration layer that ensures comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the research question. Templates provide consistency in research methodology and output format.

### Deep Research Model
Specialized AI systems that process the populated templates to conduct in-depth analysis, identify patterns, and generate insights. This component performs the core analytical work guided by the structure provided in the research template.

### Knowledge Infrastructure
The system that stores, organizes, and retrieves research findings and supporting evidence. It creates a structured knowledge base that enables fact verification, supports claims, and facilitates knowledge reuse.

### Augmented Research Composition
The process of synthesizing findings and insights into coherent research outputs. This component integrates multiple sources of information, maintains logical flow, and ensures that conclusions are well-supported by evidence.

### Final Research Output
The completed research artifact, properly formatted and ready for review. This may take the form of academic papers, reports, literature reviews, or other scholarly contributions.

## LLM Orchestration Layer Components

### Epistemic Task Decomposition
The process of breaking down complex research problems into discrete cognitive operations that can be individually measured and assigned. This approach connects to Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind" theory, where intelligence emerges from specialized mental processes working together.

### Task Profiles
Taxonomies of specific cognitive operations required for research, including:

- **Needle-in-Haystack**: Finding specific information within large volumes of text
- **Hallucination Resistance**: Avoiding generation of false information
- **Instruction Following**: Precisely adhering to complex multi-step instructions
- **Reasoning Chain Coherence**: Maintaining logical consistency through multi-step problems
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Reasoning about hypothetical scenarios
- **Knowledge Cutoff Awareness**: Recognizing knowledge boundaries

### Model Capability Profiles
Standardized assessments of each model's proficiency across various epistemic tasks, derived from benchmark performance. These profiles enable the system to match tasks with models best equipped to handle them.

### Bidding System
The mechanism that determines which model should handle each task, using several possible approaches:

- **Confidence-Based Bidding**: Models provide confidence scores for each task type
- **Performance-History Bidding**: Uses historical performance data on similar tasks
- **Resource-Efficiency Bidding**: Models bid based on computational resources needed
- **Ensemble Voting**: All models attempt the task with final output determined by weighted voting

### Task Allocation
The distribution of specific research tasks to different models based on their demonstrated strengths. This component ensures each model works on aspects of the research where it can contribute most effectively.

### Model A Tasks
Specialized in finding specific factual information within large volumes of text (Needle-in-Haystack) and precisely adhering to complex multi-step instructions (Instruction Following).

### Model B Tasks
Effectively avoids generating false information (Hallucination Resistance) and maintains logical consistency through multi-step problems (Reasoning Chain Coherence).

### Model C Tasks
Excels at reasoning about hypothetical scenarios (Counterfactual Reasoning) and accurately recognizes the boundaries of its training data (Knowledge Cutoff Awareness).

### Template Population
The process of integrating outputs from different models into a cohesive research template. This component coordinates the handoffs between models and ensures consistency in the combined output.

## Knowledge Infrastructure Components

### Vector Database System
The core storage system that maintains research documents and their vector representations for efficient similarity-based retrieval.

### Query System
The interface and processing pipeline that enables structured and natural language queries against the knowledge base.

### Document Processing
The component that handles ingestion, parsing, and normalization of research documents from various sources and formats.

### Embedding Generation
The process of converting text documents into high-dimensional vector representations that capture semantic meaning for efficient similarity search.

### Semantic Search
The system that uses vector similarity to identify conceptually related information regardless of keyword matches.

### RAG Integration
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that enhances model outputs by providing relevant knowledge from the infrastructure as context.

### LLM Context Provision
The component that formats retrieved information into appropriate context windows for language models to consume.

### Model Query Responses
The structured outputs generated by models using knowledge infrastructure content, ensuring factual accuracy and relevance.
