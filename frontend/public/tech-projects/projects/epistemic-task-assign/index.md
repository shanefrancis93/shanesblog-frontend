## Pipeline Overview {#pipeline-overview}

This research pipeline consists of five main components that work together to create a comprehensive research system:

1. **Input Processing** {#1-input-processing-implemented} - Extracts and structures user messages from transcripts
2. **Vector Database Integration** {#2-vector-database-integration-to-implement} - Provides knowledge storage and retrieval
3. **Multi-LLM Orchestration** {#3-multi-llm-orchestration-to-implement} - Routes tasks to the most capable models
4. **Research Generation** {#4-research-generation-to-implement} - Creates in-depth research content
5. **Content Assembly** {#5-content-assembly-to-implement} - Compiles findings into final output

For detailed descriptions of each component and their subcomponents, please refer to the [component documentation](/tech-projects/projects/epistemic-task-assign/components.html).

## Project Status

This project is currently in active development with the following implementation status:

- **Input Processing**: Implemented with democracy.py
- **Vector Database**: Planned implementation with Chroma DB
- **Multi-LLM Orchestration**: Under design for Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini
- **Research Generation**: Designing prompt templates
- **Content Assembly**: Planning citation and formatting systems
