# Advancing AI Research with Epistemic Task Decomposition

This project explores a novel approach to AI research through intelligent task decomposition and multi-model orchestration. The interactive diagram below illustrates the complete research pipeline architecture.

## Interactive Diagram

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Input Processing (Implemented)
- **democracy.py** extracts user messages from transcripts
- Preserves temporal context (timestamps)
- Outputs structured markdown

### 2. Vector Database Integration (To Implement)
- Add Chroma for local vector storage
- Use text-embedding-ada-002 for embeddings
- Store both user messages and research outputs

### 3. Multi-LLM Orchestration (To Implement)
- Create orchestrator class to manage LLM routing
- Support multiple models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Implement structured prompting system

### 4. Research Generation (To Implement)
- Deep research prompt generation
- Sectioned output in markdown/JSON
- Automatic chunking and embedding

### 5. Content Assembly (To Implement)
- Final blog post generation
- Section collapsing and formatting
- Citation and reference management
