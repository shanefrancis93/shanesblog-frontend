# Component Descriptions

## semantic-search
Semantic search enables intelligent information retrieval based on meaning rather than exact matches:

- Vector similarity matching for conceptual relationships
- Context-aware query processing
- Multi-dimensional similarity scoring
- Cross-reference capability across documents
- Fuzzy matching for related concepts

Integrates with RAG to enhance model responses with relevant context.

## document-processing
Handles ingestion and parsing of research documents from multiple sources:

- PDF extraction and text mining
- HTML parsing and web content processing
- Text normalization and standardization
- Metadata extraction (authors, dates, citations)
- Citation graph construction
- Document structure analysis

Outputs structured data ready for embedding generation and semantic analysis.

## LLM Orchestration Layer
The intelligent coordination mechanism that assigns specific epistemic tasks to the most suitable AI models based on their unique strengths. This layer implements epistemic task decomposition and bidding mechanisms to ensure optimal model assignment.

## epistemic-task-decomposition
The process of breaking down complex research problems into discrete cognitive operations that can be individually measured and assigned. This approach connects to Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind" theory, where intelligence emerges from specialized mental processes working together.

## task-profiles
Taxonomies of specific cognitive operations required for research, including:

- **Needle-in-Haystack**: Finding specific information within large volumes of text
- **Hallucination Resistance**: Avoiding generation of false information
- **Instruction Following**: Precisely adhering to complex multi-step instructions
- **Reasoning Chain Coherence**: Maintaining logical consistency through multi-step problems
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Reasoning about hypothetical scenarios
- **Knowledge Cutoff Awareness**: Recognizing knowledge boundaries

## model-capability-profiles
Standardized assessments of each model's proficiency across various epistemic tasks, derived from benchmark performance. These profiles enable the system to match tasks with models best equipped to handle them.

## bidding-system
The mechanism that determines which model should handle each task, using several possible approaches:

- **Confidence-Based Bidding**: Models provide confidence scores for each task type
- **Performance-History Bidding**: Uses historical performance data on similar tasks
- **Resource-Efficiency Bidding**: Models bid based on computational resources needed
- **Ensemble Voting**: All models attempt the task with final output determined by weighted voting

## task-allocation
The distribution of specific research tasks to different models based on their demonstrated strengths. This component ensures each model works on aspects of the research where it can contribute most effectively.

## model-a-tasks
Specialized in finding specific factual information within large volumes of text (Needle-in-Haystack) and precisely adhering to complex multi-step instructions (Instruction Following).

## model-b-tasks
Effectively avoids generating false information (Hallucination Resistance) and maintains logical consistency through multi-step problems (Reasoning Chain Coherence).

## model-c-tasks
Excels at reasoning about hypothetical scenarios (Counterfactual Reasoning) and accurately recognizes the boundaries of its training data (Knowledge Cutoff Awareness).

## template-population
The process of integrating outputs from different models into a cohesive research template. This component coordinates the handoffs between models and ensures consistency in the combined output.

## vector-database-system
Core storage system for research documents and embeddings:

- Efficient vector storage and retrieval
- Document versioning and tracking

- Source tracking
- Memory management

Ensures efficient use of retrieved knowledge in LLM operations.

## model-query-responses
Structured output generation system:

- Response templating
- Fact verification
- Citation management
- Confidence scoring
- Output validation
- Format consistency

Produces reliable and well-supported responses using infrastructure content.

## research-pipeline
The overarching system that coordinates the flow of information through the various stages of research, ensuring methodical progression from problem definition to final output.

## research-problem
The starting point of the pipeline, representing the complex research question or topic that requires investigation. Research problems are decomposed into manageable components for systematic exploration.

## research-template
A structured framework populated by the orchestration layer that ensures comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the research question. Templates provide consistency in research methodology and output format.

## deep-research-model
Specialized AI systems that process the populated templates to conduct in-depth analysis, identify patterns, and generate insights. This component performs the core analytical work guided by the structure provided in the research template.

## knowledge-infrastructure
The system that stores, organizes, and retrieves research findings and supporting evidence. It creates a structured knowledge base that enables fact verification, supports claims, and facilitates knowledge reuse.

## augmented-research-composition
The process of synthesizing findings and insights into coherent research outputs. This component integrates multiple sources of information, maintains logical flow, and ensures that conclusions are well-supported by evidence.

## final-research-output
The completed research artifact, properly formatted and ready for review. This may take the form of academic papers, reports, literature reviews, or other scholarly contributions.
