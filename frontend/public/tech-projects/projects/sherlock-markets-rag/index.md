# Sherlock Market Definition Assistant

This project introduces an innovative approach to healthcare product classification, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced language models to accurately map products to Sherlock's administrative expense market categories.

## The Challenge

Healthcare organizations face significant complexity when classifying products and services into Sherlock's administrative expense market categories. The Sherlock Common Guidelines, while comprehensive, present challenges in:

- Navigating extensive documentation
- Maintaining classification consistency
- Handling multi-market scenarios
- Ensuring accurate interpretation of guidelines

## Technical Implementation

The system architecture consists of four main components:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   - PDF parsing and text extraction
   - Intelligent segmentation of market definitions
   - Structured data transformation
   - Version control for guideline updates

2. **Vector Database System**
   - High-dimensional embedding storage
   - Efficient similarity search
   - Real-time index updates
   - Multi-tenant support

3. **RAG Engine**
   - Context-aware query processing
   - Intelligent prompt engineering
   - Response generation with explanations
   - Confidence scoring

4. **API and Interface Layer**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and caching
   - User feedback collection

## Key Features

### Intelligent Document Processing
- Advanced PDF parsing techniques
- Semantic segmentation of market definitions
- Automated structure detection
- Version control for guideline updates

### Vector Search Capabilities
- Efficient similarity matching
- Real-time index updates
- Multi-dimensional search
- Configurable relevance thresholds

### Multi-Market Classification
- Sophisticated handling of edge cases
- Confidence scoring for each category
- Detailed explanation generation
- Historical classification tracking

## Development Status

The project is currently in active development with the following progress:

- ‚úÖ Architecture design and planning
- ‚úÖ PDF processing prototype
- üîÑ Vector database implementation
- üîÑ RAG system development
- ‚è≥ API layer development
- ‚è≥ Frontend interface
- ‚è≥ Testing and validation
- ‚è≥ Production deployment

## Future Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Processing**
   - Support for multiple document formats
   - Improved semantic understanding
   - Automated guideline updates

2. **Advanced Classification**
   - Machine learning-based confidence scoring
   - Automated edge case detection
   - Historical trend analysis

3. **Integration Features**
   - Third-party system connectors
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Real-time classification API

4. **User Experience**
   - Interactive classification interface
   - Bulk upload capabilities
   - Custom reporting tools

## Impact

This tool aims to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of healthcare product classification by:

1. Reducing manual effort in guideline navigation
2. Ensuring consistent classification across organizations
3. Providing detailed explanations for classification decisions
4. Supporting complex multi-market scenarios
5. Maintaining an audit trail of classifications

## Getting Started

Documentation and setup instructions will be available once the initial development phase is complete. The system will be designed for easy deployment in both cloud and on-premise environments.

## Contributing

The project is currently in private development. Contribution guidelines will be provided when the project moves to a more open development model.
