# Semantic Compression Study: AI Language Models

In this interactive research study, we explore how different frontier AI models (Claude-3, GPT-4, and Grok-1) approach the challenge of maintaining semantic meaning while progressively reducing text complexity. The study features:

- Interactive visualization of compression stages
- Side-by-side model comparison
- Analysis of semantic preservation techniques
- Visual demonstrations of compressed descriptions
