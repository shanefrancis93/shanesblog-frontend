Love Haiku #1

  

Like marijuana

You bring me to new heights and

Should meet my parents 

  

#2

  

Indivisible,

Unique— you’re a prime number.

Like maybe a “3.”

  

  

#3

  

Apple of my eye

Not unlike a cataract

Slowly all I see. 

  

#4

  

Not to be graphic

But you could model nude in

Nat Geographic. 

  

  

#5

  

This poem is short 

Like art imitating life. 

[Five more syllables]

  

  

#6

  

Sweeter than songbirds,

The three words you say to me,

“I’ve an IUD.”

  

  

#7

  

I said “surprise me,”

But I meant with flowers, not

Polyamory.

  

  

#8

  

You asked my type,

And I smiled and I said “you”

And then you drew blood. 

  

  

#9

  

I’d be open to 

A relationship some day.

Not with you though, sorry. 

  

  

#10

  

Don’t compare yourself 

To your ex’s new partner. 

Cause he drives a Porsche. 

  

  

#11

  

I can safely say

You’re one in a million. 

Maybe get tested. 

  

  

#12

  

I’d name our album

“What could have been,” ft

That one coworker. 

  

  

#13

  

I have been compared   

To an eight syllable word.

Tempting, but won’t fit. 

  

  

#14

  

So much in common—

I also wish you didn’t

See me like her post. 

  

  

#15

  

If you had screwed me

As hard when we were dating

We‘d still be dating. 

  

  

#16

  

Maybe she likes me

Only ‘cause I’m really hot.

I envy the ugly. 

  

  

#17

  

Quality o’er quantity

Is a nice thought, but this poem

Lasts longer than you.
