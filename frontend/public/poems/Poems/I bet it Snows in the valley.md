Lo, I bet it snows

In the valley of the shadow of death

And the frost fills footfalls

To veil passings through its breadth. 

  

For it comes to pass, as do we all,

That this sojourn follows after fall.

Perhaps well down, beyond the bend,

I’ll see the chosen as they ascend. 

  

But at the maw of this path most traveled,

By design, I find no signs of battle. 

No broken bough or fallen leaves

On this, our journey’s natural eve. 

  

I find it queer, with our end so near

We find no struggles in the passings here.

I suppose the time has passed to fight;

For now, go gently into that good night.
