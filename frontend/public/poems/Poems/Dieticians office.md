I was at the dietitian,

(Overdue, by my admission)

She says, “it’s not a competition,”

“But I’d like to know your goals.”

  

”well, I’d like to get laid” 

I (almost) said,

But I scanned for alternatives

Deep in my head.

  

The phrasing was rough

And bordered a gaffe, but—

“I don’t think I’m hot enough

For the personality I have.”
