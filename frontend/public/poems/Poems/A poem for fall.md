Riches abound 

Beyond the bend,

Beyond descript 

Of tongue or pen.

They glisten, gleam 

On lakebed alters;

On narrow streams

Where sunbeams saunter.

  

And yet when set

To recollect,

I find I’m left 

With few regrets.

I’ve written wills

In wordless scrawls 

On conquered hills

And in footfalls. 

  

As winds of winter

Come to pass

It begs a question

I often ask:

As daylight’s dearth

For seasons slumber,

Is absence worth

The wait for summer?
