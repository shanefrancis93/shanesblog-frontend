description: "I've lived in so many places with cold winters, and the ephemeral beauty of fall is why I'd still live in those climates again."

Riches abound 

Beyond the bend,

Beyond descript 

Of tongue or pen.

They glisten, gleam 

On lakebed alters;

On narrow streams

Where sunbeams saunter.

  

And yet when set

To recollect,

I find I’m left 

With few regrets.

I’ve written wills

In wordless scrawls 

On conquered hills

And in footfalls. 

  

As winds of winter

Come to pass

It begs a question

I often ask:

As daylight’s dearth

For seasons slumber,

Is absence worth

The wait for summer?
