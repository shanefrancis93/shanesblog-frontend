They call economics “the dismal science”

And though I’ve never cared, 

I find myself now dreaming 

Of a Dismal Science Fair. 

  

Why present on cliff erosions,  

Or what keeps pumice buoyant:

When you can model plant explosions

And their results on town employment?

  

Skip the smells of vinegar

And the dank of papier-mâché. 

What happened to the price of pottery 

After the cautery of Pompeii?

  

Oh, the graphs and poster board 

And oh, the things they’ll bear

I can’t imagine a grander day

Than the Dismal Science Fair.
