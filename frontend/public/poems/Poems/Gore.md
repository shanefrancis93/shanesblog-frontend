The cops looked beyond the pale

As they kicked down the door 

And saw entrees of my entrails 

On the table, walls and floor. 

  

Most of me was lit by moonlight

Or the kitchen’s fluorescent opalescence,

On a towel across linoleum

That smelled of fresh petroleum.

  

  

  

My disembodied head,

In a disassembled semblance 

Of my thoughts and id and ego

And all my seven senses,

Stripped to non-essential,

The circuits on the motherboard, 

The proper copper wiring

Welded to my power core.
