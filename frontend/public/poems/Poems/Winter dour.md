We often wish for a world devoured— 

For the ground consumed

In winter dour. 

  

Bite by bite the horizon fades

And by night the white is all what remains. 

  

Seldom sound nor color is found

With contentment born in the death of the natural world. 

  

While we often reap of what we sow,

I also wish for a world of snow.
