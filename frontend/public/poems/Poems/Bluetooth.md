To the Brain Witch

  

What if in therapy’s stead

I could send my disembodied head,

In a disassembled semblance 

Of my thoughts and id and ego

And all my seven senses.

  

Normally a cause to panic

To the non-macabre mechanic—

As the pools left on linoleum

Won’t smell of fresh petroleum.

But when I’m down to essentials,

The circuits on the motherboard, 

The proper copper wiring

Welded to my power core,

I can be booted into Safe Mode

And put my back-up in the cloud,

And with a click I could reload

And my login sound would be loud.

  

  

And I’m in search of tinkers

Who specialize in thinkers

Who navigate the knots

In the neural network blots.

  

Maybe I need Bluetooth
