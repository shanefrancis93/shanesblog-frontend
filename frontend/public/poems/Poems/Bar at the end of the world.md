Somewhere 

At the edge of the world

Is a bar built to code 

Under an ancient jurisdiction.

  

The barman

Watches over his patrons

And their past

And present and future

With his three eyes.

He tells us he’s blind 

In one of them,

But won’t say which. 

  

The selection is eclectic;

Lightning in a bottle

Takes up the top shelf
