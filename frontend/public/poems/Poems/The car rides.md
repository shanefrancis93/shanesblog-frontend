Do you remember those car rides 

Late at night, long after conversations,

Like burnt cigarettes, have left our lips 

And lingered past perceptible?

  

Each passed streetlight would flood us

And trap your image in amber

Making you, as I’ve always seen you,

One in Vermillion. 

  

Our obligations are immaterial

But to arrive at some discrete point B, 

Whereafter life takes the wheel again

Into the oncoming lane.
