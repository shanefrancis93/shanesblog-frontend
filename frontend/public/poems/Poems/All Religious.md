We’re all religious;

Some of us are just less specific. 

To sin is to be human 

Is to be judged 

Is to be stoned with suggestions 

Cast forth by the especially pious

Or biased. 

But blessed be those who try us.

  

You know who.

Who tempt and taunt

And tear asunder 

Any altar to alter

The gods we worship.
