I believe in ghost stories

  

  

  

  

I see them float on streets below

As if nothing is amiss.

Spectral echos, or those who’ve let go

And wandered to the abyss. 

I used to speak and try to grasp

The ghosts of friends of former pasts.

To reach beyond the fold of Fall, 

Whether ever here at all.
