Beware the frost,

Beware the rime,

Beware the cost

Of foregone time. 

  

The blessed blade

That cuts the sound,

Like earthen spade

In frozen ground,

Will sever squabble

Among sojourn friends,

Who seek the bauble

Of Journey’s End. 

  

Beware, beware

The mariner’s spite;

The fight of heirs

Beneath moonlight. 

So bend the knee

And blindly trust;

Lest Mariner leave

Naught but dust.
