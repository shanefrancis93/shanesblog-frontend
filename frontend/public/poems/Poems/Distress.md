You’re not entitled to anyone’s time. 

You can wither and rot

And writhe in 

  

Why am I like this 

Why am I shapeless

Exploitative, manipulative 

Just the culmination of every negative

And regressive trait

Thrice confirmed annually

Why is the world I thrive in 

The allocation of resources

Why are psychopaths 

Of the world so uniquely 

Disproportionately 

Driving 

  

This is not the direction I want

Yet I reach for the steering wheel

To shift the wheel 30 degrees 

And instead I find oncoming traffic
