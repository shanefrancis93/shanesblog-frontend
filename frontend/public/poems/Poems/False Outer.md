I seldom think 

Without a drink

One could find one’s outer’s brink

Where thoughts may run the goblet over:

Forthright answers, forbidden sober. 

  

But in this place of Serena’s Grace 

I tread forward, face-to-face

Against the sky of the Maker’s place.

Where if His Herald were to appear

I’d not be surprised if the Coming’s here.
