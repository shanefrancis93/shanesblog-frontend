“It’s not a race.”

But I always ‘need’ to either

Pick up the pace or about face to

Arrive at the “Good Place.” 

‘Cause in my case, “straight-lace” may 

Go face-to-face with the meaner reality:

I bring my own gravity. 

It’s sad to me—

in the wake of the world’s depravity,

I still choose to be so mad at me. 

Or not “mad” at me, exactly but

success is a matter of “matter-of-factly” 

To me. And see, this leads me to be

Chronically dissatisfied 

As insecurities metastasize

And I realize, 

my life’s never been about the journey.

  

As the lesions form legions 

Led by General Anxiety,

Marching on the battlefield inside of me,

I lie to me: 

Wasted time is spent searching for my soul

When satisfaction sits adjacent to the Goal.
