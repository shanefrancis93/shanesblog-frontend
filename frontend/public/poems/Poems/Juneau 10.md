I’ll miss you more than the sum of when we part.

  

Though, I appreciate the pieces:

The looks that speak without stating

Or the laughs that earn their creases

On your olive-pigment plating. 

The way you smile rivals sunrise

Sending cynics to the pews.

Blessed be the little lie

That any of us deserve you.

  

To quote the guy in the shopping aisle,

You’re an easy “Juneau 10.”

But what I appreciate the most

Is your terrible taste in men.
