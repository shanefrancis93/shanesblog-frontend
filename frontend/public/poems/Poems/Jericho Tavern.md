The manager squeaked as the guests ran amok

Pushing and shoving and not letting up.

He ran to his office though noticed a pattern:

Such were all days at the Jericho Tavern. 

  

He lent hospitality to the barely hospitable

And to make matters worse

Than the guests’ manners formidable 

The tavern’s financials had him interred:

It was a wonder the banks would even insure!

  

Gabriel sighed, and reached in his desk,

And pulled out a flask 

Filled with something grotesque.

He drank and he drank 

And as he thought of the past

In the corner of his eye

he spotted well-polished brass.

A family heirloom, he knew, 

An instrument of old

A trumpet with trimpits of ivory and gold. 

  

He remembered the warning

Of “paranoid yore”

To regard it with reverence—

To not play it indoors. 

  

And Gabriel knew but chose to eschew

The rationale not to blow.

Silence befell,

And suddenly,

well,

The walls of Jericho fell.
