Well John went to Harvard,

And he finished best in class...

He said it was all hard work,

And while I know you didn’t ask,

He could vacation in the Ozark’s,

Foster a Guatemalan,

Translate into Spanish Mozart—

And his grades wouldn’t have fallen!

Sorry to hear your son passed,

How old was he? Six..?

At that age John was cast 

Among his youth theatre’s top picks

To be a career thespian

Like my sister, who never married

*Who I think had become a lesbian*

After she miscarried.

Oh, me? 

  

I know it may sound odd,

But I hate talking about my life.

For I’m simply a daughter of God,

And simply a good man’s wife.
