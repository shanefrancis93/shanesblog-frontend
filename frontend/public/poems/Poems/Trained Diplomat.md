My dog is a trained ambassador, I assume,

Or a high-powered diplomat.

It’s revealed in how she charms a room

In fifteen seconds flat. 

  

Maybe she’s a foreign spy

That Russia sends when stakes are high.

I don’t know how much of that I buy

But she checks for bugs on the fly. 

  

Of languages, English is not her first

(And I can tell by how she responds).

But a Russian spy wouldn’t be the worst

(Since I’ve always had a thing for blondes).
