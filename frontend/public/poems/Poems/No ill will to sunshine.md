I’ve no grudge toward sunshine.

At best, ambivalence to rain.

But it’s in the morning fog, I find, 

A silver-lining in the gray. 

  

The air’s not quite biting

And time passes at a crawl;

There’s seldom more inviting

Than coffee after Fall. 

  

  

It’s where coffee is more biting,

Time passes by a crawl,

Seldom is less inviting 

Than a cup of coffee after fall.
