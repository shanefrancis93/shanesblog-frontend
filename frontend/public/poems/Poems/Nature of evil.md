Persistent, the existence of evil

Eludes and evades our best intentions.

Across centuries, it endures reform and upheaval

And the bitter won wars of lesser contentions. 

  

Yet ships set sail in the sea of despair,

Where no captain commands that which they cross,

Or can order a still to the malevolent air

Or reclaim the jettisoned ballast they’ve lost. 

  

I plead at the port that they not go

Or prepare for the worst at storm’s end

And to abandon hope for the evil they know 

For enemy’s enemy is rarely a friend.
