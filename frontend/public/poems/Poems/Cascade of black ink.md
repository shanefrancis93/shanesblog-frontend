A cascade of black ink 

Could rain down 

And write into existence 

editors’ comments.

Gulches of Red 

earth would divide through

Ordained Mistakes.

  

Word would travel 

On man’s keenness to critique

The names of those

Who were circled

Or underlined. 

  

We find ourselves left

With a realization 

We don’t know our title;

Perhaps we’re a draft.
