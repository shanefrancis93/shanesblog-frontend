Smite me down, heavenly God;

Find me like a lightning rod.

Cast Your bolts down through the blue

I beg, I ask, I pray to You—

  

Open the Gates (or text me the code)

I’ll even pay rent to lessen the load.

I’ll wash my own dishes, 

I’ll care for the Trees—

We can even split down the HOA fees. 

  

I studied and worked as any one should,

I aimed for great and settled for good.

But as Jesus said,

Given the economy of Rome,

“I’m done with this—

I’m moving back home.”
