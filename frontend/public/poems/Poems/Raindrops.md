I remember the times we sat

Stoned in cars, captivated by streetlights

And blessed by the rhythm of rain on my windshield. 

  

Like raindrops, every idle thought dripped into our world

And we drowned any silence in their depths. 

  

I wonder how many times we solved all my problems

Or yours, or the world’s 

As we found God in my backseat with us,

Who would whisper the words 

“In the long run, we are all dead [anyway].”
