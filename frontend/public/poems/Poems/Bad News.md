Imagine you were given bad news,

And it’s the real kind

The kind where it’s persistent 

for your field of focus

In the same way locusts might tear apart a flea market. 

  

The bad news grips your tightening throat

To answer the Trolly Problem

And you, the lever, are left wondering 

Your role in all of it.

  

You’re given this bad news 

As if you’re an interior designer

Asked to place begonias 

In your finished desert theme. 

  

But as bad as the news is,

Little lurks beyond 

A bond of common sorrow

So what struggles you fight today,

You’re welcome to bitch tomorrow.
