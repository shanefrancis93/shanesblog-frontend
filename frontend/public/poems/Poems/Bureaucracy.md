I’ll file things in triplicate

And sign the dotted lines. 

And whenever we go into it

I’ll nod the thousand times.


To speed the pace of paperwork and

Public oversight,

And begrudgingly I say it,

But the Libertarians were right. 

  

My life is on the operating table, 

Several agencies long,

And my guts and dreams are splayed
 
As life support beeps along.


Anesthesia is a rich man’s drug,

So I cry myself to sleep

And observe my surgeons briefly

Before fading in the Deep. 
  

The bureaucracy is noxious

And with all the oversight I’m caught in,

We could’ve landed on the moon again 

Or actually killed Bin Laden.
