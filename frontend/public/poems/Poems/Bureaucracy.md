I’ll file things in triplicate

And sign the dotted lines. 

And whenever we go into it

I’ll nod the thousand times

To speed the pace of paperwork and

Public oversight,

And begrudgingly I say it

But the Libertarians were right. 

  

My life is on the operating table, 

several agencies long ,

And my guts and dreams are splayed and labeled as life support beeps along.

As anesthesia is a rich man’s drug,

I cry myself to sleep

And observe my surgeons briefly

Before fading into the Deep.

Rural Development issues intent 

To find Alaska on a map, 

And the SSA marks their discontent

Of being woken from their nap. 

The IRS gives sweet caress

To my financials as they patter,

And HUD flips me over 

In their usual bedside manner. 

  

The bureaucracy is noxious,

And with all the oversight I’m caught in,

We could’ve landed on the moon again 

Or actually killed Bin Laden.
