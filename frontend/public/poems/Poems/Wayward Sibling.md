Even on the darkest night

Against expanse of withered light

The moon persists in tepid glow 

To observe the absurd of those below. 

  

How amusing she must find us,

Not tied in shackles, but never bind-less

Not free from rhythm and static sways,

Or our constant chase for better days. 

  

Though perhaps the moon is only morbid,

And knows she slowly descends from orbit

And fears what she sees became of us;

Her wayward siblings of former dust.
