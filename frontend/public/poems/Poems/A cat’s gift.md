My cat brought in a dead bird

To replace the one 

I mistakenly threw out, 

And hid it under the couch

For safekeeping,

To preempt a repeated offense. 

  

If the bird pressed well,

I’d‘ve placed it in a scrapbook

Or taped it to my fridge 

Like a supportive parent might For mediocre, macabre

Macaroni art.

  

Alas it did not, and so I relent

For it to get stuck in the uncovered vent.
