Be aware around heavenly bodies,

Your stargazing and grazings at night,

As you’ll gravitate toward Lunacy 

If you learn to love by moonlight.

  

Look to the tides and how they abide 

To the highs and lows of their Siren‘s song. 

How they writhe under the Moon’s clutch,

And how they erode what they touch. 

  

Don’t learn to love by moonlight

If you need it never to wane,

Or If waxing must bring warmth to you

Then I’m very sorry to say:

Learn to love by moonlight 

And that choice may be binding—

As you spend your days only as nights,

Sunshine becomes blinding.
