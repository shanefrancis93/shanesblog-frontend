Sometimes

The fog hangs high on the island

Leaving unobscured the coast

And the sky 

And leaving to the imagination

What would fill the middle.

  

I don’t mind it;

The B between A and C

Is often the least novel

In a deterministic universe. 

  

But if one day the fog did lift,

And instead of forest and mountains...

  

If the vale beyond the veil 

Disappeared

As a gust blew through 

And offered clarity,

We’d all be a little less smug, wouldn’t we?
