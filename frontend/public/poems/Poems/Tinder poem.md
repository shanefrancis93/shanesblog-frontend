Men can be fat or miniature or stout,

They can be bold, they can be brash; 

They can stamp all about.

  

They can gamble and smoke 

They can drink til they’re blue.

I’ll ignore all their citations;

“Honey, you just do you.”

  

But where I won’t falter

Or even begin, 

As a matter of culture

He better hide his weak chin.
