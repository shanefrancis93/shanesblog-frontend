I’m fluid;

I’m fit for any container,

So pour me forth 

With eager candor 

And watch me fill a niche. 

But in Alaska I’m molasses.

I am mid-April’s taxes:

Forced and inflexible though

Incredibly as indelibly 

Consigned to some agency 

Beyond that of mine. 

We all adapt

And bleed past our corners

And edges, past the mourners,

Past the coroners who attribute

Cause of Death to seismic shifts. 

Who am I but fluid? 

Who am I when dehumidified

But an ignoble gas

But like neon, I will shine. 

But peculiarly.
