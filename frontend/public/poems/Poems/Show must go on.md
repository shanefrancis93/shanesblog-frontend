In moments of somber clarity,

The magic wanes,

The charm ends,

The spell wears off,

And the illusion fades

As the curtains close across

The theatre of the mind. 

  

Only in these intermissions 

Between acts 

Do we realize the sky ends

At the backdrops,

And only in the houselights 

Appear the wires holding aloft

Our fantasies of order. 

  

“All the world’s a stage,”

Though the audience exists

Within oblivion,

Absent the due progressions 

Of storytelling

And envious of the closures.

And lo, the show must go on.
