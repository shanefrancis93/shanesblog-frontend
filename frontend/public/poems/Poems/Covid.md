Every few days, there’s another nine-eleven,

So I plan to bring a book, if ever I end in heaven. 

The seating’s getting thin,

St Peter’s called in sick,

Getting through the Pearly Gates likely won’t be quick. 

  

If it were the Iraqis, we’d turn their land to glass.

If it was Antifa, we’d cram them into camps. 

If it was Advil, we’d force them to recall,

But since it’s Covid, we don’t do much at all.
