Every few days, there’s another 9/11,

So I plan to bring a book if ever I end in heaven. 

The seating’s getting thin,

And St Peter’s called in sick-

Getting through the Pearly Gates likely won’t be quick. 

  

If it were Iraqis, we’d turn their land to glass.

If it was Antifa, we’d cram them into camps. 

If it was Advil, we’d force them to recall,

But since it’s only Covid, we don’t do much at all.
