Would that I could

Give away these slices of paradise.

Would that I’d contain them  

In round, glass cake cases

By my window,

And offer them to travelers,

Weary or otherwise 

And feed them until they were full.

  

The mindful may ask

From whence and wherefore 

I’d collect them, 

And in comfort I’d claim

They were gifts

I’m encouraged to share.
