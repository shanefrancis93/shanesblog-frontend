I had a dream I kayaked down a stream next to my home. 

It didn’t feel like a dream, despite unrealities:

I did not feel a current. 

I did not endure mosquitos.

I did not own a home by a stream.

  

It fed into a canal flanked by two roads.

The cars moved silently, breaking the sun’s rays to the quiet water ahead of me

In irregular and sudden eclipses. 

  

At last, I hear a sound!

Ahead the stream feeds into a river,

Away from the cars and at a pace to rival them. 

I lifted my oars to let the new current take me to the river

And to wait,

And relax...—

  

Though I could not, I realized, take to the river

Or let it take me.

I had business unfinished, and tasks delayed

And not the daylight to let the river take me

And do with my time what it (and I) desires. 

  

I dipped my oars again to turn around,

Fighting both a current of desperate water and pleading mind

To abandon the obligations that weighed like an anchor 

On my soul with rapture so near. 

  

But I returned home. 

And I lifted my kayak from the water, and opened the door.

  

And I woke up. 

I heard a scratching, and a meowing at my door,

And as I let her in, she promptly fell asleep, and the secrets of the river with her.
