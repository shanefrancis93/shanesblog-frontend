Never earn the ire

Of your sundown, summer sprite.

For the fey favor fire

Else their eldritch delights. 

  

But her eyes spoke psalms

In a tongue I could not know,

And when laid bare, her hair

Was lifted by her glow. 

  

She asked if I would follow

‘Neath waves and deep below,

 And if I could hear it 

When on went my spirit,

Marching with hers in tow. 

  

But as moonlight fades

To lack of luster,

And as I wade 

I do not trust her. 

  

For what can be scried

May not be her purpose;

After all, sprites lie,

And I can’t breathe beneath the surface.
