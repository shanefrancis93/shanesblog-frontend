“Write what you know”

The substitute said, 

Glancing the clock 

And scratching his head. 

  

Gonzales was new

And a good enough bloke 

And unlike Ms Lu,

Hasn’t suffered from strokes. 

  

  

  

So when he took to the class

Like a feudal farm’s lord,

We gave him a pass 

And tried not to look bored. 

  

With pencil to temple

And tongue into cheek 

I scratched at my chin

At a topic to seek. 

  

  

  

I thought of all wonders

And wondered aloud

If lending to listening  

Would be considered allowed

  

For what I don’t know

I reckon you might 

And if you’re too slow

I’ll find someone bright.

  

  

  

And I may not attribute 

Where knowledge may spout

But I always contribute

If theres no room for doubt. 

  

And so, Mr Principle,

I hope you’ll give me a pass,

For my reasoning was sensible 

When I cheated in class.
