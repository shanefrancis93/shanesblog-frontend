What if California split

On its 11th Quinceanera?

Saying “adios, gringos,”

As it severed the Sierras.

  

If it sanded out its valleys 

Born from continental eras 

Exposing gold and quartz

In the broken, churning areas.

It would be the evening news

And the news the next day

Of the sundering and the plundering 

That would follow in its wake. 

  

And as we’d deliberate the meaning

And the outcomes this could yield,

We could finish our Spring Cleaning

And drop off Bakersfield

Where it could find a better match

And maybe feel free to roam 

In that great pacific garbage patch

Where it could finally feel at home.
