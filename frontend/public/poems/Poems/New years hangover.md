I’m not quite the religious sort

But I’m always one for a bit of sport,

And so the days came and went

When I gave up sobriety for my Lent. 

  

Though now on the eve of forty days,

Near reprieve of my spirits raised,

The looming hangover begs a solution

“Perhaps this is now a year’s resolution.”
