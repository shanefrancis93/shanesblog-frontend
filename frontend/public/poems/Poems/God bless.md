If only under the veil of stars

May I find my spirit in ‘twine with yours

I’d covet sleep and it’s sweet embrace

For its fortuitous fruit that invoke your face.

  

Of all the fantasies near and far

Of those beyond the furthest star

I’d hold you closer in liminal place;

God bless our time in this time and place.
