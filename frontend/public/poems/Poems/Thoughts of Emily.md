The policy must be perfect,

The brief beyond compare,

The i’s must be dotted—

It *needs* to read as fair. 

  

It must be revenue-neutral,

Self-sustaining, stimulating.

Sound statistically-significant,

Stands to reason: entertaining. 

  

I want actuarial analyses,

Annotations for allocations.

Anticipate the allegations and

No accidental alliterations,

(This time). 

  

Draft the memo immediately 

And contact you-know-who without delay

I’m forwarding you the timeline: 

“I want this yesterday.”
