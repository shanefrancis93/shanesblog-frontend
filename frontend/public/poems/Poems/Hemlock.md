Often I ponder

In lax states of wonder

The boldness of evil 

And all that it sunders

  

All of the fates it dispels

And timelines is fells 

Through the presence of evil

And extensions of Hell. 

  

I’ve heard they rouse good

In shouldn’t’s to should

Though the pre-reqs of evil

Are even less understood. 

  

Rare do we receive reprieve

From the worst we can conceive.

Are we not the spawns of evil?

Or did hemlock grow in the Garden of Eve?
