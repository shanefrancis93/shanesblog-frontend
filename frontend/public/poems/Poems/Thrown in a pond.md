When given a lifetime

To count upon the infinite iterations

Of what I could have said,

Or had done, distinctly or differently, 

I think I’d find 

The same ambivalence of any raindrop

Pelted against a landscape,

Far from any sea that begat it. 

  

We are the sum

Of the entropy we contribute,

Each together obligated to make a difference

And stir the calm

Of otherwise still water. 

  

I don’t care much what you throw in the pond though. 

Just don’t intend to retrieve it.
