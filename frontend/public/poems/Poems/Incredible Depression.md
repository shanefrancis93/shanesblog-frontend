I hung up my head

In wordless distress

And expressed to my friend

I was clearly depressed. 

  

“I wake up in mourning,

All listless and blue,

With a physical ache 

And yet numbness there too.”

  

“I’ve lost interest in interests 

And friendliness to friends,

I’ve abandoned my Pinterest

And I’m behind on the trends.”

  

“I’ve also quit Tinder 

And instead swipe on Zillow—

Imagining new lives 

Safe from my pillow.

Maybe a condo in Brisbane,

Or a townhouse in Tucson

To host nights of champagne 

And dance without shoes on.

  

I’d say with a sigh, and then with a wish:

“I’d set sail for Seattle, if, only if—“

  

“You think YOU’RE depressed?”

The friend interjected,

With the grace of a guest

Who arrives unexpected. 

  

“I sleep on my laundry,

I’ve not showered in days;

I only ever shave

When I’m in-between lays.

Sure, what you say sounds kinda bad,

But when it comes down to it—

I’m the definition of “Sad.” 

  

And out from his coat 

Came a long, lengthy scroll

Of woes to now gloat 

From meticulous scrawl.

  

I was filled in on follies

And informed of ill-thoughts

And all his melancholies

Which, God, there were lots. 

  

I sat and I listened,

As an unwitting abetter,

But what do you know—

My depression got better.
