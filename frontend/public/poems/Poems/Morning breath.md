I think of you often

And the time we spent drinking

And the hazy thoughts

Of how this time together 

Would make me welcome 

An alcohol problem. 

  

After all, 

Only in morning’s sobriety 

Were we anything but a good idea

And we ran from dawn

As lovers might 

Even as our lungs gave 

And forced an inhale 

Of cold clarity. 

  

I wanted to hold my breath
