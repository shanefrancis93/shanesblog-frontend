Man seeking partner

Who knows their way with knots

And knows all the safety words

And likes their harness taut.

  

Now, experience is preferable,

But I‘ll be your first 5.10.

And if the impression’s seminal 

We can always go again. 

  

And maybe no strings attached—

We can always only boulder

And experiment with hands or

Maybe heel hook a shoulder. 

  

I’ve had some different partners

—Can’t count the times I’ve strayed

Or the times I’ve let them down  

‘Cause I’m just looking to get belayed.
