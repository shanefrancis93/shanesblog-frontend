Hope is a Thing with Stingers

That circles ‘round the trees 

It whizzes and bobs 

  

Often in jest 

It’s referred as a pest.

But I know it best

As a wonderful guest. 

  

In fact I envy the Wasp

And it’s impressive design;

Though it’s colors and stingers

Will never be mine. 

  

But I imagine my world

Envisioned by Kafka

Where I awake and unfurl

And eat spiders like pasta. 

  

And it can’t be too bad

In what it halts or it hinders

Since having a small prick’s

Not stopped anyone on Tinder. 

  

  

Sure, it will never take off it’s jacket

But for the social mores it lacks it

Charms
