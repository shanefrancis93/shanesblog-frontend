I went to Disability and asked if the Human Condition qualified for benefits. 

The woman said no, 

But that her mother had it, 

And she strongly assumed she did as well

Though had no official diagnosis. 

  

She told me her insurer denied coverage

For her self-care claims often. 

On her desk was a binder of receipts

And she opened it to the latest page:

“76 miles worth of gasoline”

From here to the Shrine of St Therese.
