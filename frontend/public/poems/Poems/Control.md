I fear the thought of failing you,

Whoever you might be. 

I fear the thought most of all

Of not defining me. 

  

What if instead you looked yourself

Attempting neutral light,

Without my expertise

To offer context to that sight?

  

I fear the thought of being maligned, 

And so I’ve lived by one convention:

Some attempt to be complex,

But I am fine with one dimension.
