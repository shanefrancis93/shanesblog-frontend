Between every one is a black dotted line

Except with your destined—

It’s red, scented twine.

It should waft in the breeze 

And bend but not break

And cast an aroma of forests and lakes

Or campfires and memories

Of time spent together,

Or plans to be made 

(And contingencies for weather). 

  

Unfortunately, I’m color-blind,

And lately I’ve a cold,

So any red-colored colored line

Isn’t a sight to behold. 

And the scent may be pungent

But paired with poor sense,

While it’s probably perfect

It’s less than intense. 

  

So, I may admit that our thread is gray.

And if so, that’s still swell. 

And the time I‘ve gotten to spend with you

Is probably sweeter than its smell.

  

But while I can’t tell it’s color

Or fidelity to trope,

It offers me better:

It offers me Hope.
