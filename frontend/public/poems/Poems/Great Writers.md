I wonder if Frost got writer’s block

While he wandered ‘round the woods. 

If his bin was full of foregone thought

Of weighted ifs and shoulds. 

  

Did Huxley sigh and throw his hands

As he practiced words aloud

Of rhyming schemes and meter plans 

Of concepts “bloody, but unbowed?”

  

When Dickinson wrote of “Hope” 

And compared it to a bird,

Did her effort to rhyme 

the very first line 

Inspire a new four-letter word?

  

I wonder if great Nabakov, 

With rows of prose like pearls,

Doubted if he was subtle enough

When describing little girls. 

  

I compared myself to the greats

(If only for a bit),

As I have to assume, if at lower rates,

They’ve also written ****.
