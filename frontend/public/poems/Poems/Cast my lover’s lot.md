I’ve loved and lost—

—Near cast my lot

Along the last of lovers’ thoughts;

“To learn to live a lonesome life

“Til lastly lifted toward the Light.”

  

Where would we be

If with wanton ease,

We wind up weary

In the webs we weave?

I’d wish and want to wait to wake,

With withered worth

And weathered weight,

‘Fore walking through

The Water and Reed—

I’d waste my wit and wade in weed. 

  

“Why?”

Why wonder when to want to “win”

With wonders wont to wax within?
