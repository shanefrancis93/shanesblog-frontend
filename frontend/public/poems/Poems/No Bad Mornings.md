I appreciate the mornings most

Where the daylight fails 

to persuade the streetlights 

Their evening watch has come to close. 

Wherein the hues of the sky

Find similar quarrel

And break our landscape into

Contested territories

Of orange, pink and blue.

In any other tapestry,

Good taste would protest

And yet I can find no ill words today.
