I resolved to write in a stream of consciousness,

But the pipes froze over the winter.

Leaks pour from the cracks

In growing pools of wasted thought. 

“Call a repairman,” a neighbor suggests

(She suffered from leaky pipes too). 

“No,” I said. I was embarrassed. 

But the flow of thought has begun to slow

As I turn on the facet. 

And the leaks have eaten at the foundation of the house.
