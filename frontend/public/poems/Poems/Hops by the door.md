Would that I could 

Bottle and brew beer

From the hops my dog does

By the door. 

  

In that a skilled connoisseur

Appreciates a fine whine,

I can admire her performance 

(Though cliched), evermore. 

  

She’s tart as I tarry

Like a sour IPA

As every second that I dally

Is one less she can play. 

  

Off like a shaken seltzer

Adjacent to saccharine,

No other dog means no chaser;

With a buzz, there’s no need. 

  

I think the ale would sell well 

And stock in every store

For she only needs an hour

Before she’s passed out on the floor. 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

She’s unaware that I’m wary

Of this ruse for her quarry

When I open the door.  

  

And so that I’d think

I’d like to drink 

  

I give in to the inevitable

So she seeks out the inedible

And terrorizes this lawn

Like the many before. 

  

To scarf down some grass 

  

I think that I’d drink

Something tart if I tarry

A fine whine 

  

  

No need for wheat 

Similarly, sans sugar 

It’d be tart if I tarry 

And frankly I’m wary

  

  

  

I think that I’d drink 

Something tart if I tarry too long;

She wants out like I want a stout

To top off the day 

Where we’ve done nothing at all. 

  

I know she wants out 

As much as I’d like a stout

To top off a day 

Where we’ve done nothing at all. 

  

It’d be a sweet kind of stout 

From the impatient pout

As I saunter too slowly 

To the door. 

  

I’d use the excitement, the anticipation,

If both could be easily distilled. 

  

  

I’d hazard a guess

It’s immediate success
