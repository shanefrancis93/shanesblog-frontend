I want to wash the chalk marks off the ceiling and hang lights instead. 

I want water and stardust to run down the wall

And fill the ocean 

And for the tide to swell and bring this astral foam to Our coasts. 

  

I want Us to be washed over

And our birthright altered: not to rule over the fish in the sea

And birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals 

And not each other either, but over Our selves. 

  

I want the sediments of Heaven 

To guide the sentiments of Man

And make Us again curious.  

  

I want to lift the mountains and check under them for dust. 

I want to Spring Clean.
