I asked God once 

On our evening walk 

If he’d give away the finale 

And save me the seasons

That’ve deteriorated 

  

The world ended yesterday

As the sun set to swallow 

The sounds    

  

The wind hisses behind us

As we move jointly, single-file

Toward allures of abject justice

Not much further, just a mile.
