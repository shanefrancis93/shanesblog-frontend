“Excuse me, good sir, but I have a request:

And I’ve come to you now to look over your best.

If it’s not too much trouble, 

But I’m not willing to beg, 

I’d like a fresh dog, but missing a leg.”

  

I looked at the woman, and then at the clock.

It was a strange sort of phrasing, but we had them in stock. 

“There’s a sweet Irish setter, with red and brown fur,

And there’s a dachshund as well, if that’s the size you prefer. 

  

The woman shook her head, 

And then shook her jowls,

And stated the following in ear-splitting howls:

“I don’t want a dachshund or red Irish setter,

I won’t settle for less, so you’ll settle for better!”

  

“I don’t want a pug or Labrador poodle

I don’t want a mutt, so don’t misconstrudle—

I know what I want, as is my right in this nation,

I want a three-legged, spotted Dalmatian!”

  

“But miss,” I insisted—

“It’s missus,” she hisses. 

  

“Missus, we have a Dalmatian, 

spotted, in-fact,

Though I regret to inform you, 

she’s fully intact.”

  

“So just take one off,” the woman replies,

Drumming her fingers and rolling her eyes. 

“Or give me a discount, if you so desire,”

“Since the three-legged dog comes with assembly required.”
