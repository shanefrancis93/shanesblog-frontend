I might not be the brightest,

The best in sports,

Or the best is shorts

I may not be the kindest,

‘Tween pettiness 

And last retorts.

  

But I bring to the table

Whenever I’m able 

The stories, the songs,

The half-true fables,

The whispers of wisdom

Born of trial and error,

The sardonic approach

Of unresolved terrors.
