Cased in steel above the trees,

Wafting in the summer breeze.

It’s been two hours since the freeze,

With tourists disquiet in their unease. 

  

The wind then gifts a gentle shake

And I hear the snap

and crackle 

and break

That only an emergency brake

Could make, 

As it fizzles and fails 

And falls below,

And soon enough,

They’re all in-tow.
