Above the clouds 

And clandestine calls

For callous cowls 

And conscious 

  

  

I understand the dreams of flight 

To go and meet the morning light

And melt in the warmth of a closer glow

As I’d swim to where the river flows. 

  

The lagoons I’d cross of clouds and clout

Dampen rays or blot them out 

But I’d ascend further—

To infinity and beyond—

To chase an eternal sunshine

Where all the haze is gone.
