  
The Builder King

  

King Leopold arrived in hell

  

To a smell of burning rubber. 

  

With his arms in stumps

  

His throat held lumps

  

As the sTEWARD soon appeared.

  

An ebony bEING of Ivory teeth 

  

Smiled and glowered

  

At hIS mortal conceit.

  

“As befitting to Kings,

  

I greet you in-kind:

  

I extend you mY home

  

For your home, you’ve made mINE.” 

  

“Seldom does God ever answer His prayers

  

Of deliverance from Man 

  

Or his manmade despairs.”

  

“But Leopold, your highness,

  

i answer requests.

  

And brought Hell to the Congo 

  

At your behest.”

  

A million black hands arose from the floor 

  

And grasped at the Belgian

  

As nine million more

  

Ascended the crust

  

And broke through the earth, 

  

Writhing and guided

  

Like moths to a hearth.

  

“i torture the souls of the wayward and damned 

  

And shackle the shambles who feast on His Lambs. 

  

i ask in return for only one life—

  

For every soul culled in the Congolese strife.“

  

The people of Belgium Heard none of this uttered 

  

Though the city of Brussels 

  

Now smells of burnt rubber.
