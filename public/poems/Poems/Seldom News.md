Seldom news, in its skews for views,

Cues me to queue for deserved dues.

It’s true it spews and strews along 

The notes of a hateful, ungrateful song.

  

But if in season, I had to choose,

And yet to choose to eschew the booze,

I suppose what I’m most thankful to

Are the blessings I have left to lose.
