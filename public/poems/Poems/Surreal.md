When I was a dental assistant,

A new patient named Frank arrived

With the widest mouth I’d ever seen. 

As he spoke, we lost Agnes in his gums 

As he turned his head to gesture

To our two copies of March 2015 Sports Illustrated

And asked if we had anything more recent. 

I shook my head, goading to no avail

For him to do the same. 

  

His number eventually came

And he told me something felt lodged

In a back row of teeth. 

I asked if it could be a septuagenarian 

Or something else he recently ate
