Your face looks like the sound of Gilbert Gottfried reading Mein Kampf. 

If someone ever again got lost in your eyes,

I’d hope they’d leave breadcrumbs 

To attract hungry birds. 

  

You are the embodiment of

Bringing up browser history in a eulogy

Or voting Jill Stein in the 2016 Presidential Election. 

  

I’d ask you 

“Where do you get off?”

But Apple Maps can only support so many active pins at once.
