“Quality over quantity”

Is a heuristic uncritiqued;

As it presumes the boons

Of a bellumist muse

Are discrete and non-oblique. 

  

But as with war,

Measures are mired

By bias, beholders 

And what was aspired.

Seldom attempts, 

Or the numbers of tries

Are recorded in annals 

Just what was written 

As the ink dries.

  

But, by all means,

Stand by your best,

With feet firmly planted 

On the mounds of the rest. 

  

  

  

Aspire to thrive

But first survive

The warring bands 

  

But as in war, there is no score

But simply who can throw out more. 

Waiting to then first be inspired

Is akin to waiting in lines of fire. 

  

  

If you’d wait to be inspired—

Seldom wiser than in a line of fire.

As few enough ideas survive

And fewer still go on to thrive. 

  

But I struggle to jot

The warring thoughts

Of precedent’s past

And
