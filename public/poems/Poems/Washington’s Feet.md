I saw crowds at Washington’s feet

As children—his and theirs, were rested.

This Founding Father, found father now to those separated from theirs,

Remained stoic. 

  

Lincoln sat similarly stone-faced. 

Arms raised in the face of his tyranny—

To secure freedom, and freedom from it,

Rested at least 600,000 of George’s children,

And 600,001 by the end of his Presidency. 

  

Maybe this is why they never talk.
