If I were dating or doting again

And if while I’m sating I’d try it with men,

I’d end all my settling and go for a ten 

I’d take some self-love to its natural end. 

  

The “benefits” are as you expect;

You keep the books balanced 

When you pick up the check. 

They’ll pick the best movies,

You share the same bands,

Regardless of headaches

They’ll lend you a hand. 

  

But it’s not always quaint,

Cause quite often you’ll quarrel

If they don’t care for themselves

And have questionable morals. 

But learn some self-love 

Before pursuing your next—

If you break up with yourself

You make a hell of an Ex.
