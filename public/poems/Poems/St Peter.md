St Peter

  

Saint Peter sits on his porch in the mornings,

Reading “The End Times” as his coffee stays inexplicably warm in his hands.

The sun has remained on the horizon

In-place until everyone who wished to see it rise has, and this morning it seems an aspirant has slept in.

“Fine with me,” he says, flipping to the Sports section.

At some point he had to go to work,

Though since his first day,

He’s inexplicably never been late. 

  

  

  

  

From his porch he can already see the line of bodies, or souls rather,

Congregate outside the gates to seek judgment

Despite a lifetime of fleeing from it. 

The shadows ran across his headlines

As the sun began to rise now.

“The Angels beat The Angels.”

He read the line and smiled. 

An upset, but stranger things do happen. 

  

  

  

  

And by his will he was at his lectern,

Facing his ordered congregation, many refusing to meet his eyes.
