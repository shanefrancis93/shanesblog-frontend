The mountains in the distance

Pose as these future threats

But I am not afraid—

But I’m as anxious as it gets.

  

For I know what’s on horizons:

Lands before me, given time. 

I have mountains to the south of me

And if I can’t fly I’ll surely climb. 

  

But I fear now,

I don’t climb alone

And I will only drag you down. 

I fear now, 

A rising tide lifts all the ships;

A short anchor makes you drown. 

  

Climbing over mountains

And climbing through the mists

I look around and can’t see shit

But I know that I want this. 

  

Weren’t you climbing with me,

On this tether I feel strain

Through the fog and fury of this climb

I forget all but my own name. 

  

So hear me now:

I only climb alone;

For when I shoulda pulled you up, 

I will only put you down. 

Hear me now:

A rising tide lifts all the ships

But I will only bring you drought. 

  

On the top now stands a flag

Bearing your own name. 

I look behind me for your face

To learn the game you played. 

  

I glance to
