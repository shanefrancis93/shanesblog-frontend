I don’t know much taxonomy

Or gastropod economy,

But regarding policy “ought-to-be’s”

I’m sympathetic to the slugs. 

  

Slow to buy a home to own;

No loans to find a spiral cone.

And If you have a bone to pick,

Best to take it with a tick:

The fleas that fleece you of your blood

Deserve the worst before the slug. 

  

But they’re slimy, gross, and full of fault,

Unlucky favorites of the occult,

And I fail to find them worth their salt

When I pair their trails in their gestalt.
