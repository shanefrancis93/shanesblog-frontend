I paused and thought of what to send 

As fingers tapped the screen,

It would portend some kind of end 

Though outcome unforeseen. 

  

The eve’s wound down; it’s 10PM

And I know she works at six,

So should I wait to send DMs 

Until the caffeine fix?

  

If I waited, it’s just easy:

“Do you take your coffee black?”

“Do you take your breakfast greasy;

Will you take the heart attack?”

  

“Do you find the bus reliable,

Or what about your friends?

Do you find me at all desirable—

Haha, JK... Depends.
