Have you ever watched the start of Spring,

As color floods— the color Green,

And what was buried comes unearthed,

And what was dead now finds rebirth?

  

O, what I assumed lost now comes again!

—From ‘neath the surface

Or from their dens. 

On shrubs I thought that winter maimed

I see the start of this season’s claim. 

  

Through bloom and breeze,

My heart’s at ease

As winter’s work 

Gives leave to Leaves.
