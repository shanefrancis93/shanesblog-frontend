I’ll write a line and change a word,

But then “Is it mine,

Or what I’ve heard?”

  

I wonder of the long-late greats,

And wonder if their great estates

Would go wade into these debates.

And perhaps that would be for the best

That at their behest I’d acquiesce

And hang my hat upon the door

And bless a dearth forevermore. 

  

  

  

Poetry’s a trial by fire 

And God do I feel uninspired.

  

A drip-drop of pretense

A dollop of 

Draw the meter where cadence sings;

These are a few of my favorite things.
