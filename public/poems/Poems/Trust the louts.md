Trust the louts 

And the screeds they shout;

For they are blunt 

In what they spout. 

  

They may call you names 

And bang on doors, 

But that’s quite tame 

From what I’ve known before. 

  

For the quiet and calm 

Can convey their thoughts 

In eloquent qualms

From elegant yachts. 

  

They can persuade the folk 

They only mean well

When they clamp on the yolk

And prep them to sell. 

  

Professionals are nasty

When you’re driven to strike;

For one can only speak softly

When one’s holding the mic.
