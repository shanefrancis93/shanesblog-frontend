Heave, ye wretched,

Ye twisted and bound

For the fate ye have sketched

I will not allow.

  

Share me your visions

Of bent, rotted bough,

Of fruit beyond feast 

And an allure of its glow.

  

But I’ve had my fill

For knowledge’s sake

And I find little

Is worth its weight.

  

Of adversaries formidable,

Your soldiers cast in Jade,

I find the least pitiful

To be the demons that I’ve made.

  

Ye may open the floodgates

And salt my own fields,

But I will restate

That I will not yield. 

  

And I won’t suppose 

I know what comes

In further woes 

Or unknown tongues.

  

But I know this

From my own psalms 

I fear no evil,

Though I have no qualms.
